;;;; FEATURE-EVAL

(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
  (defvar *feature-evaluators* (make-hash-table)))

(defun feature-eval (expr)
  "Returns the result of evaluating the feature expression EXPR using
extended feature evaluation rules:

Symbols evaluate to T if they are present in *FEATURES*, and NIL otherwise.

Non-symbol atoms evaluate to themselves. (Standard feature expressions do no
accept non-symbol atoms at all.)

Conses evaluate depending on the operator in the CAR:

  :AND &rest expressions

    If all EXPRESSIONS evaluate to true, evaluates to the value of the last of
    them. If no EXPRESSIONS are supplied, evaluates to T. Otherwise evaluates
    to NIL.

  :NOT expression

    Evaluates to T if EXPRESSION evaluates to NIL using extended feature
    evaluation rules, NIL otherwise.

  :OR &rest expressions

    Evaluates to the value of the first of EXPRESSIONS that evalutes to true.
    NIL otherwise.

   QUOTE expression

    Evaluates to EXPRESSION.

  :EQ expression1 expression2
  :EQL expression1 expression2
  :EQUAL expression1 expression2
  :EQUALP expression1 expression2

    Evaluate to T if EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 evaluate to values that
    compare to true using the similarly named Common Lisp predicate. Otherwise
    evaluate to NIL.

  :TYPEP value-expression type-expression

    Evalutes to true if VALUE-EXPRESSION evaluates to a value that is
    an TYPEP of the type-designator TYPE-EXPRESSION evaluates to.

  :FIND-PACKAGE package-name

    Evaluates to the designated package if it exists, NIL otherwise.

  :FIND-SYMBOL symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to the designated symbol if named package exits, and the named
    symbol is an external (or accessible, if ALLOW-INTERNAL is true) symbol in
    it. Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :FIND-FUNCTION symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to the designated function if the named package exits, the named
    symbol is an external (or accessible, if ALLOW-INTERNAL is true) symbol in
    it that is bound to a function and is not a macro or a special operator.
    Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :FIND-MACRO symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to the designated macro-function if the named package exits, the
    named symbol is an external (or accessible, if ALLOW-INTERNAL is true)
    symbol in it that is bound to a global macro. Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :FIND-VARIABLE symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to T if the designated symbol if the named package exits, the
    named symbol is an external (or accessible, if ALLOW-INTERNAL is true) and
    BOUNDP symbol. Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :FIND-VALUE symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to the SYMBOL-VALUE of the designated symbol if the named
    package exits, the named symbol is an external (or accessible, if
    ALLOW-INTERNAL is true) and BOUNDP symbol. Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :FIND-CLASS symbol-name package-name &optional allow-internal

    Evaluates to class associated with the designated symbol if the named
    package exits, the named symbol is an external (or accessible, if
    ALLOW-INTERNAL is true) symbol in it that has an associated class
    definition. Otherwise evaluates to NIL.

  :SBCL-VERSION>= desired-version

    Evaluates to T if the host lisp is SBCL and DESIRED-VERSION is
    greater than the host version, otherwise evaluates to
    NIL. DESIRED-VERSION must be a string composed of non-negative
    integers separated by #\. ; while the host version is computed by
    removing the commit id(if present) from the return value of
    LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION.

  :CCL-VERSION>= desired-version

    Evaluates to T if the host lisp is CLozure CL and DESIRED-VERSION
    is greater than the host version, otherwise evaluates to
    NIL. DESIRED-VERSION must be a string composed of non-negative
    integers separated by #\. ; while the host version is composed of
    the major version, minor version and SVN revision id(if present).

In all of these both SYMBOL-NAME and PACKAGE-NAME can be any string
designators.
